# Basic Base Converter to Base 10 with Tkinter GUI:
I've implemented a simple tkinter GUI application that facilitates the conversion between bases (8, 2, 10) to base 10. 
The application is designed to handle user input gracefully and display '_Error' in red as a background if any issues arise.
## Notice : 
Please note that if you encounter errors or the application doesn't function as expected, feel free to make necessary modifications to the code.
